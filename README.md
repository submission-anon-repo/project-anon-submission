# Anonymous Submission to ICME

This repository contains the **core code** accompanying our anonymous submission to **ICME**.  
To maintain anonymity during the double-blind review process, all identifying information has been removed.

---

**Due to anonymity constraints, only essential components are provided.**  
We plan to release the full codebase, including training and evaluation scripts, configuration examples, extended experimental settings, and ablation tools **after the review process**.
